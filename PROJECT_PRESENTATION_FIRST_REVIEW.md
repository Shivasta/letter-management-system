## SLIDE 3: INTRODUCTION

The MEF Portal, in the context of "Educational Leave Management System," refers to a comprehensive web-based platform focused on automating and streamlining the leave request approval workflow in educational institutions. The system implements a multi-tier approval hierarchy (Student → Mentor → Advisor → HOD) with features like real-time status tracking, role-based access control, PDF generation for approved requests, and mobile-responsive design to overcome limitations of manual paper-based systems, maximize administrative efficiency, and make leave management more accessible, transparent, and integrated into institutional operations, moving beyond basic paper forms to a smart, automated digital solution.

## SLIDE 6: IDENTIFIED PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing leave management systems in educational institutions are not able to process requests efficiently due to manual paper-based workflows and lack of automated multi-tier approval tracking and real-time status visibility.

This results in delayed processing, lost paperwork, lack of transparency, and poor administrative efficiency.

Hence, an innovative digital leave management solution is required to automate the approval workflow, enable real-time tracking, and improve institutional efficiency.
